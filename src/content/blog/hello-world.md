# Welcome to my new blog

Hello and welcome to my newly redesigned blog! I've rebuilt my site using [Astro](https://astro.build/) to create a faster, more maintainable, and more enjoyable writing experience.

## Why I chose Astro

After using Jekyll for my previous blog, I wanted something that offered:

- **Better performance**: Astro's static site generation with minimal JavaScript
- **Modern development experience**: TypeScript support, component-based architecture
- **Markdown-first**: Excellent support for markdown content with frontmatter
- **Easy deployment**: Simple GitHub Pages deployment workflow

## What to expect

I'll be writing about topics that interest me:

- **Compiler technology** and obfuscation techniques
- **Security research** findings and methodologies  
- **Java development** and JVM internals
- **Open source projects** I'm working on

## Current projects

I'm actively working on several projects:

- **Skidfuscator**: A Java obfuscator using SSA form for advanced control flow obfuscation
- **Artemis Anticheat**: A server-side anticheat system for Minecraft
- **Research papers** on obfuscation and compiler techniques

Stay tuned for more technical deep-dives and project updates!

## Get in touch

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/terminalsin) or check out my [projects](/projects) page for more details about my work.
